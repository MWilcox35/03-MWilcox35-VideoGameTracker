Currently, the only file in this repository is an application meant to serve as a proof of concept. It is a revision of the "SimpleApp.java" application from the demos that are included in the 10.14.2.0 version of Derby. Where the code differs is that it uses JavaFX to display the contents of the databases. 

The requirements to run this program mirror the requirements for the original SimpleApp.java. You will need Apache Derby, and you will need to set up derby's class path by following the directions found under "How to run this sample application in an embedded environment" in the file: demo/programs/simple/example.html in your Derby zip file.
